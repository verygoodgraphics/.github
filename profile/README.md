VeryGoodGraphics (VGG) is an **embeddable** cross-platform UI development framework that advocates the **Design-as-Code** paradigm.

The Design-as-Code paradigm enables developers to leverage design drafts as the starting point for UI development, treating them as a type of vector graphics resource.

And VGG facilitates effortless integration of programmed designs or prototypes into applications by providing VGG containers for various platforms and frameworks.

When we discuss VGG, it may refer to any of the following VGG components within the VGG framework:
- [**VGG Specs**](https://docs.verygoodgraphics.com/specs/overview) is an open format for describing vector graphics and UI.
- [**VGG Runtime**](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) is a C++ implementation of VGG Specs with cross-platform rendering and scripting capabilities.
- [**VGG Containers**](https://docs.verygoodgraphics.com/containers/overview) is a set of thin-wrappers and adapters of VGG Runtime for various platforms and frameworks, that provide high-level APIs for developer users.

VGG is still at an early stage. Please join in VGG community and help us build it together!
