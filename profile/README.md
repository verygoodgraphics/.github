VeryGoodGraphics (VGG) is an **embeddable** cross-platform UI development framework that advocates the **Design-as-Code** paradigm.

The primary objective of VGG is to empower developers to code directly  within design drafts, such as those in Figma, Sketch, Adobe, or any  other design formats, and seamlessly integrate the programmed files as  functional UI elements into existing applications.

It currently consists of three main components:
- [**VGG Specs**](https://docs.verygoodgraphics.com/specs/overview) is an open format for describing vector graphics and UI.
- [**VGG Runtime**](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime) is a C++ implementation of VGG Specs with cross-platform rendering and scripting capabilities.
- [**VGG Containers**](https://docs.verygoodgraphics.com/containers/overview) is a set of thin-wrappers and adapters of VGG Runtime for various platforms and frameworks, that provide high-level APIs for developer users.

VGG is still at an early stage. Please join in VGG community and help us build it together!
